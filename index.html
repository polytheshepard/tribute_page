        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Yukio Mishima was a Japanese author, poet, and playwright. He was mainly known for 
            forming the <em>Tatenokai</em>, a small militia group that attempted to restore Japan's 
            national values which would eventually lead to his death through seppuku. In spite of his
            political stance, he was generally known for his novels and short novellas.</p>
            
            <p>He was an internally
            conflicted person as it reflected from his father's refusal to accept his son's gift for
            writing. It was not until Mishima was physically exhausted from his position in the government's 
            Finance Ministry that his father allowed him to pursue his passion for writing. He wrote his first
            controversial semi-autobiographical novel, <em>Confessions of a Mask</em> depicting a homosexual 
            who must mask his sexual preferences from society. Through this initial success he proceeded to
            write his latter greater works, <em>The Temple of the Golden Pavilion</em>, <em>The Sea of Fertility</em> and 
            <em>Death in Midsummer and Other Stories</em>.</p>
            
            <p>He developed a writing style that would echo the dichotomy of the private
            life imbued with a character's contradicted throughts and feelings alongside with the expectations of society.
            This synergised his darker concepts of death, love and living where the changing force of Japan's current political
            environment was growing rapid. While Mishima lived a short life, he was a significantly occupied person despite of 
            his difficult childhood. He took up acting having starred in the film <em>Afraid to Die</em> alongside directing 
            his own films such as <em>Yukoku</em>. He also picked up weight training where his workout schedule included three 
            sessions per week and continued for the last 15 years of his life. Mishima believed in living life to the fullest, 
            as written in his final words before he committed seppuku:</p>
            
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Human life is limited but I would like to live forever.
            </p>
            <cite>-- Yukio Mishima</cite>
